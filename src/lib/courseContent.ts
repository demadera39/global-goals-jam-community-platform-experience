          <li><strong>Apply the Iceberg Model (25 minutes):</strong>
            <p>Work through each level, spending 5-7 minutes per level:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>EVENTS (Visible):</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>List specific incidents you can observe</li>

                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>PATTERNS (Trends):</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>What repeats over time?</li>
                  <li>When/where do problems concentrate?</li>
                  <li>What triggers or cycles exist?</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>STRUCTURES (Systems):</strong>
                <ul>

                  <li>Which institutions are involved?</li>
                  <li>What infrastructure enables/constrains?</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>MENTAL MODELS (Beliefs):</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>What assumptions do people hold?</li>
                  <li>Which values drive behavior?</li>
                  <li>What stories do we tell ourselves?</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          
          <li><strong>Map Causal Loops (15 minutes):</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Identify at least one reinforcing loop (vicious or virtuous cycle)</li>
              <li>Identify at least one balancing loop (stabilizing force)</li>
              <li>Draw simple diagrams showing connections</li>
              <li>Example: Poverty → Poor Education → Limited Jobs → Poverty (reinforcing)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          
          <li><strong>Find Leverage Points (15 minutes):</strong>
            <p>Using Donella Meadows' framework, identify:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Low Leverage (Easy):</strong> Numbers/constants you could change</li>
              <li><strong>Medium Leverage:</strong> Feedback loops you could strengthen/weaken</li>
              <li><strong>High Leverage (Hard but powerful):</strong> Paradigms you could shift</li>
              <li>Be specific about what you would actually do</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          
          <li><strong>Design Your Intervention (10 minutes):</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Select 2-3 leverage points to target in your jam</li>
              <li>Explain why this combination</li>
              <li>Describe expected system response</li>
              <li>Identify potential unintended consequences</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          
          <li><strong>Create System Sensing Questions (10 minutes):</strong>
            <p>Write 5-7 questions that will help jam participants understand the system:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>"What keeps this problem in place?"</li>
              <li>"Who benefits from the current system?"</li>
              <li>"What would have to be true for this to change?"</li>
              <li>"Where do we see exceptions or bright spots?"</li>
              <li>Make them specific to your challenge</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Success Criteria:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>✓ All four Iceberg levels thoroughly analyzed</li>
          <li>✓ At least 2 causal loops identified</li>
          <li>✓ Leverage points at multiple levels found</li>
          <li>✓ Clear intervention strategy designed</li>
          <li>✓ Thought-provoking system questions created</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Time Required:</h4>
        <p>80 minutes (can split into two sessions)</p>
        
        <h4>Pro Tips:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Mental models are often the most powerful leverage point but hardest to see</li>
          <li>Look for "bright spots" - where is the system already working well?</li>
          <li>Consider time delays - changes at deep levels take time to surface</li>
          <li>Remember: In complex systems, you probe-sense-respond rather than analyze-plan-execute</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Using This in Your Jam:</h4>
        <p>This assessment becomes the foundation for your jam design. Share the Iceberg analysis with participants to help them see beyond surface events. Use the leverage points to guide solution development. The system questions become powerful discussion prompts during the jam.</p>
